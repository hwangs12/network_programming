/* Although this is not cpp executable, the idea is worth sharing */

/* There are billions of routers with ip */

/* when we try to reach dns, it asks for AAAA-type or A-type record */

/* Once you receive you can connect to that server */

/* There are billion routers to choose from how do request/response work so wonderfully? */

/* How do we know which routes were taken for us to reach the destination server? */

/* one way to find out is using traceroute */

/*
 Traceroute tells us which ip it walked through
