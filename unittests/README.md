### A unit test is a test that covers a single component or small piece of functionality in an application. In a framework-less unit test, there is no predefined structure or set of rules to follow. This means that the test can be written in any language and does not require a specific testing framework. 

#### - Framework-less unit tests are often used to test specific functionality in a system that is not easily testable using a traditional testing framework.

#### - For example, if you want to test how a system responds to a specific input, you can write a unit test that sends that input to the system and then checks the output. 

#### - Framework-less unit tests can be useful when you want to test something that is not easily testable using a traditional testing framework. However, they can also be more difficult to write and maintain than traditional unit tests. 

### There are a number of reasons why developers might choose to write unit tests without the use of a framework. 

#### - In some cases, the code under test may be too simple to warrant the overhead of a framework. 

#### - In other cases, the developer may be more interestsed in testing the code itself, rather than the framework surrounding it. 

#### - One advantage of writing unit tests without a framework is that it can help to keep the test themselves simple and focused.
