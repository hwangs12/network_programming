#include <iostream>

/* TYPE */

// bool
// int
// char

// for 16 bit computers, int is thus equivalent to short, whereas for 32-bit computers int will be equivalent to long.

// char <= short <= int <= long

// short comprises 2 bytes and long 4 bytes

// dec and hex change value to decimal and hexadecimal numbers

// constants: boolean constants, numerical, character, string constants

// octal begins with 0 and hex begins with 0x

// the ranking for decimal constants are int, long, unsigned long
