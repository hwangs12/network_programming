# TIC-TAC-TOE design

## Design a tic tac toe game that each networked client can play

## using tcp connection, client will connect to server using telnet and get a prompt for the game board

## Once connected, those on the server side will also receive the input prompt after the client plays the first horse. 

## Board is 3x3 and will be labeled with column value, A, B, C and row value 1, 2, 3, so A1 is the top left corner of the board, for example. 

## once done, can I let multiple clients connect to the server?
