# EXAMPLE

## 1 HOW ARE YOU 
## 2 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER
## 3 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER + NETWORK HEADER (SENDING A, RECEIVING D)
## 4 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER + NETWORK HEADER + MAC-HEADER (MAC ADDRESS OF A, B)
## 5 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER + NETWORK HEADER + MAC-HEADER (MAC ADDRESS OF A, B) + ELECTRICAL SIGNAL

# IMPORTANT

## LAYER DOES NOT EXAMINE DATA IN OTHER LAYER

# FORWARDING MACHINES

## INTERMEDIARY MACHINES DURING TRANSPORT - THEY ARE CALLED FORWARDING MACHINES

## DE-ENCAPSULATION HAPPENS ONLY UP TO NETWORK LAYER AND DATA LINK LAYER

## TRANSPORT LAYER DOES PROCESS TO PROCESS DELIVERY. IT KNOWS ABOUT APP2, BUT DO NOT KNOW ABOUT D

## NETWORK LAYER KNOW SOURCE TO DESTINATION DELIVERY. KNOW ABOUT DESTINATION NEXT HOP BUT DO NOT KNOW ABOUT APP2 THE DATA FROM TRANSPORT LAYER

## LAYER FUNCTIONS

### 1. EVERY LAYER HAS ITS OWN WELL DEFINED FUNCTION TO PERFORM
### 2. ALL LAYERS WORK CLOSELY TO MAKE THE PACKET JOURNAY FROM APP1 TO APP2
### 3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF EACH LAYER IS WELL DEFINED, AND ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER
### 4. EACH LAYER HIDES ITS OWN INFORMATION WHICH IS ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM THE LAYER ABOVE AND BELOW IT
#### - FOR EXAPMLE, NETWORK LAYER DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT APP2 TRANSPORT LAYER INFORMATION AND NEXT HOP B MAC LAYER INFO

### WHEN THE APPLICATION GENERATES DATA, TRANSPORT CREATES A SEGMENT, NETWORK LAYER CREATES A PACKET, DATA LINK CREATES A FRAME. WHEN THE DATA IS PLACED IN PHYSICAL FORMAT THEN IT BECOMES BIT

## NETWORK PROGRAMMING FROM SCRATCH IN C
### OSI MODEL: TRANSPORT LAYER CHECK PORT NUMBER, TCP IP LAYER CHECK DEST IP, DATA LINK LAYER CHECK DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS, PHYSICAL LAYER CHECK INCOMING PACKET JOURNEY

### PHYSICAL LAYER PUT THE PACKET ON WIRE, DATA LINK LAYER ADD ETHERNET HEADER, TCP IP LAYER ADD IP HEADER, TRANSPORT LAYER ADD TCP HEADER

### TCP IP SUITE RESIDES IN OS ITSELF

### DATA LINK , TCP LAYER, TRANSPORT LAYER BELONG TO SYSTEM CALL INTERFACE, AND OS.

### system call interface request services of the operating system. For example, malloc does that work. 

### hardware includes cpu, gpu, memory and many other hardwares, os interact with hardware using drivers.


### Transport layer is responsible for keeping the data from different applications separate on a network layer

### application is identified using port no in case of udp/tcp traffic. network layer & data link layer has no knowledge what application produced the data. All it knows is communicating machines, not applications because there is no information present in their respective headers which represents the application in some way.

### tip: The transport layer divides a data stream into segments and may add reliability and flow control information.
