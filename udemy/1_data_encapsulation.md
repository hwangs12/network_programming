# EXAMPLE

## 1 HOW ARE YOU 
## 2 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER
## 3 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER + NETWORK HEADER (SENDING A, RECEIVING D)
## 4 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER + NETWORK HEADER + MAC-HEADER (MAC ADDRESS OF A, B)
## 5 HOW ARE YOU + TP HEADER + NETWORK HEADER + MAC-HEADER (MAC ADDRESS OF A, B) + ELECTRICAL SIGNAL

# IMPORTANT

## LAYER DOES NOT EXAMINE DATA IN OTHER LAYER

# FORWARDING MACHINES

## INTERMEDIARY MACHINES DURING TRANSPORT - THEY ARE CALLED FORWARDING MACHINES

## DE-ENCAPSULATION HAPPENS ONLY UP TO NETWORK LAYER AND DATA LINK LAYER

## TRANSPORT LAYER DOES PROCESS TO PROCESS DELIVERY. IT KNOWS ABOUT APP2, BUT DO NOT KNOW ABOUT D

## NETWORK LAYER KNOW SOURCE TO DESTINATION DELIVERY. KNOW ABOUT DESTINATION NEXT HOP BUT DO NOT KNOW ABOUT APP2 THE DATA FROM TRANSPORT LAYER

## LAYER FUNCTIONS

### 1. EVERY LAYER HAS ITS OWN WELL DEFINED FUNCTION TO PERFORM
### 2. ALL LAYERS WORK CLOSELY TO MAKE THE PACKET JOURNAY FROM APP1 TO APP2
### 3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF EACH LAYER IS WELL DEFINED, AND ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER
### 4. EACH LAYER HIDES ITS OWN INFORMATION WHICH IS ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM THE LAYER ABOVE AND BELOW IT
#### - FOR EXAPMLE, NETWORK LAYER DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT APP2 TRANSPORT LAYER INFORMATION AND NEXT HOP B MAC LAYER INFO

### WHEN THE APPLICATION GENERATES DATA, TRANSPORT CREATES A SEGMENT, NETWORK LAYER CREATES A PACKET, DATA LINK CREATES A FRAME. WHEN THE DATA IS PLACED IN PHYSICAL FORMAT THEN IT BECOMES BIT

## NETWORK PROGRAMMING FROM SCRATCH IN C
### OSI MODEL: TRANSPORT LAYER CHECK PORT NUMBER, TCP IP LAYER CHECK DEST IP, DATA LINK LAYER CHECK DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS, PHYSICAL LAYER CHECK INCOMING PACKET JOURNEY

### PHYSICAL LAYER PUT THE PACKET ON WIRE, DATA LINK LAYER ADD ETHERNET HEADER, TCP IP LAYER ADD IP HEADER, TRANSPORT LAYER ADD TCP HEADER

### TCP IP SUITE RESIDES IN OS ITSELF

### DATA LINK , TCP LAYER, TRANSPORT LAYER BELONG TO SYSTEM CALL INTERFACE, AND OS.
