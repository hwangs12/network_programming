We need networking topologies consisting of routers, switches and hosts which could exchange/route packets

Mininet is a network emulator which creates a network of virtual hosts, switches, routers and links connecting them on a single linux machine

Using Mininet, you can create Network Topologies on your single Machine - equivalent to as if you have access to real network in the lab

We can write any network application and deploy on mininet. Same applicaion can be deployed in real network deployments with Zero code changes. 

After this tutorial, I will be able to
1. deploy network topologies quickly
2. configure - l2 routing, l3 routing, vlan based routing, inter vlan routing
3. develop networking based projects and applications using sockets
4. network packet capture and debugging
5. write socket program and applications and test them on topologies

pre-requisites
1. basic knowledge of osi model
2. virtualization software - i use vmware workstation player
3.
