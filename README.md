## Ultimately, the goal is understanding network programming and writing it in CPP but AFTER understanding everything. I will not progress without UNDERSTANDING. BUT,

## the link above is pretty advanced. I will still be reading it occasionally - so I will go back to basics first: 

## [Books on cpp](https://github.com/ikoHSE/Books-1/blob/master/C%2B%2B/A_Complete_Guide_to_Programming_in_C%2B%2B.pdf)

## I am starting with Complete Guide To Programmingin C++

## Another note, videos are less intimidating. To follow along is another quesiton:

## [youtube on socket programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gntyAFoZp-E)

## Another interesting video I bookmarked and plan to start watching was about using OOP to create crypto trading platform. Sometimes, I do not want to think creatively and let the instructor do the job for you especially when crypto is on hype (was?) [link link link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-v/home/week/1)

## Google has some nice [CPP course](https://developers.google.com/edu/c++) which you can scroll through and solve problems. The issue is as you are reaching the end of the course, the some hard concepts are not very motivating to make you solve that problem. Bad excuse, I know, but that was for me. Maybe I will come back later. So, see you later those hard problems. 

## leetcode
## euler problems

## I am being lazy here, so no link for problem sets. just google.

### good books additions

#### - book/Computer Networking_ A Top-Down Approach, Global Edition, 8th Edition.pdf

#### - Hands-On-Network-Programming-with-C

### Also try doing hardware NIC, writing NIC driver software - what's the learning path.
